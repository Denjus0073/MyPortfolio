            <h1 class="rule">My Story</h1>

            <h2 class="rule">Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                I started with hands-on tinkering—taking apart PCs, rebuilding them, and helping friends
                choose and assemble reliable machines. That curiosity expanded into small-form projects with
                Raspberry Pi and Arduino for home automation and hive monitoring.
            </p>

            <h2 class="rule">Turning Points</h2>
            <ul class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:1rem;">
                <li>Shifted from hardware into software: HTML/CSS/JS and then C# and Blazor.</li>
                <li>Explored operating systems across Windows, macOS, and Linux to understand the stack.</li>
                <li>Dove into networking and security tools (Wireshark, Metasploit, Kali) to build breadth.</li>
                <li>Lean manufacturing and service roles sharpened my focus on quality and people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="rule">Today</h2>
            <p>
                I build clean, performant web apps with Blazor WebAssembly, favoring modular components,
                maintainable code, and a craftsman’s approach to quality. I enjoy the full loop—design,
                implementation, testing, and iteration.
            </p>

            <h2 class="rule">Beyond Code</h2>
            <p>
                Beekeeping keeps me patient and observant; writing sci‑fi keeps me creative. Both inform my
                engineering style: calm under pressure, detail‑oriented, and always learning.
